## ✨ Intro

A Claude Code sidekick running on a **PaperS3** (4.7" e-ink,
540×960, touch, ESP32-S3). Sits on your desk and mirrors every
Claude Code session you have open: project, branch, model, context
usage, recent activity, Claude's latest reply. When Claude wants to
run a tool, the full content shows up as a full-screen approval card
with hardware buttons and touch options.

---

## 🎛️ Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 📊 **Multi-session dashboard** | Left column lists every active Claude Code window; tap a row to focus. Right column shows model + context-window progress bar. |
| 🔐 **Hardware approval** | `PreToolUse` shows a full-screen card with the complete command / diff / preview. **PUSH** approves, **DOWN** denies. DND mode (long-press **UP**) auto-approves for batch tasks. |
| 💬 **Touch-answer questions** | Claude's `AskUserQuestion` options render as up to 4 big tap targets; tapping sends the chosen label back as the answer. |
| 🔁 **FIFO queue** | Multiple windows asking for approval get queued; resolving the current one automatically pops the next. |
| 🀄 **Bilingual UI** | 3.4 MB CJK TTF shipped on LittleFS; toggle **English ↔ 中文** in the Settings page. All prompts, replies, activity lines render Chinese correctly. |
| 🔌 **Two transports** | USB serial (default, zero-setup) or BLE (Nordic UART, macOS passkey pairing), auto-selected. |
| ⚙️ **Settings page** | Tap **SETTINGS** (top-right) for transport / battery / sessions / DND / budget / uptime / last message / language toggle. |
| 🐱 **Cat buddy** | A small ASCII cat in the footer reacts to state — idle / busy / attention / celebrate / DND / sleep. |
| 🔌 **Claude Code plugin** | One `/buddy-install` handles PlatformIO + Python deps + mklittlefs arch patch on Apple Silicon + hooks merge + firmware + filesystem flashing + daemon launch. |

---

## 🛠️ Hardware

- **PaperS3** (4.7" e-ink, 540×960, touch, ESP32-S3, 16MB flash)
- USB-C cable (required for initial flash; BLE works afterwards)

---

## 🚀 Quick start

**Prereqs**: [PlatformIO Core](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/),
Homebrew (Apple Silicon only, for native `mklittlefs`), and a PaperS3.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/op7418/m5-paper-buddy.git
cd m5-paper-buddy

# Recommended: install as a Claude Code plugin.
# Register the plugin/ directory with Claude Code, then:
/buddy-install
```

`/buddy-install` automatically:

1. Verifies PlatformIO is installed
2. Installs Python deps (`pyserial`, `bleak` for BLE mode)
3. On Apple Silicon, **patches PlatformIO's x86_64 `mklittlefs`**
   (`brew install mklittlefs` + symlink) so `uploadfs` can run
4. Merges the hook block into `~/.claude/settings.json` (backs up first)
5. If a Paper is plugged in, **flashes firmware + filesystem (font)**
6. Launches the daemon in the background

**Manual install (no plugin)**:

```bash
pio run -e papers3 -t uploadfs          # flash the font to LittleFS (~90s)
pio run -e papers3 -t upload            # flash firmware (~30s)
python3 tools/claude_code_bridge.py --budget 200000

# Then manually copy plugin/settings/hooks.json's hooks block into
# ~/.claude/settings.json
```

The default flashing target is now `papers3`. If you still need the legacy
M5Paper build, use `-e m5paper` or set `BUDDY_PIO_ENV=m5paper`.

---

## 📟 Daily use

Once installed, these slash commands are available in Claude Code:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/buddy-install` | First-time setup / re-verify environment |
| `/buddy-start` | Start the daemon (idempotent) |
| `/buddy-stop` | Stop the daemon |
| `/buddy-status` | Daemon pid, serial device, hooks state, tail of log |
| `/buddy-flash` | Rebuild + reflash firmware AND filesystem (stop → flash → start) |

State directory: `~/.claude-buddy/` (pid, log).

---

## ⌨️ Controls

| Button / zone | Dashboard | Approval card |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PUSH** (middle) | nudge a redraw | **approve** |
| **DOWN** (bottom) | toggle demo | **deny** |
| **UP** (top) | short: force GC16 refresh (clears ghosting) · long ≥1.5s: toggle **DND** | — |
| Tap session row | focus that session on the dashboard | — |
| Tap `SETTINGS` | open settings page | — |
| Tap option card | — | answer `AskUserQuestion` |

---

## 🔌 Transport

Default is `BUDDY_TRANSPORT=auto` — USB serial if plugged in, else BLE.

```bash
BUDDY_TRANSPORT=ble    /buddy-start
BUDDY_TRANSPORT=serial /buddy-start
```

First BLE connect triggers macOS's system pairing dialog; the Paper
displays a 6-digit passkey, you type it on the Mac. Subsequent reconnects
are automatic.

---

## 💰 Context budget

The progress bar shows the **currently-focused session's**
context-window usage divided by a limit, computed from the last
assistant message's `usage.input_tokens + output_tokens` in the
session's transcript JSONL.

Default limit is 200K (Claude 4.6 standard context). For the 1M-context
4.7 beta:

```bash
BUDDY_BUDGET=1000000 /buddy-start
```

Set `0` to hide the bar.

---

## 🌐 Language toggle

Default: English. Tap **SETTINGS → language / 语言** to switch to 中文.
Choice persists in NVS across reboots.

## 🧩 Development

Firmware iteration:

```bash
pio run -e papers3              # build only
pio run -e papers3 -t upload    # flash firmware
pio run -e papers3 -t uploadfs  # refresh LittleFS (only when font changes)
```

Daemon iteration:

```bash
/buddy-stop && /buddy-start
# or:
plugin/scripts/stop.sh && plugin/scripts/start.sh
```

Tail the log: `tail -f ~/.claude-buddy/daemon.log`

## 🙏 Credits

This project was inspired by Anthropic's
[`claude-desktop-buddy`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-desktop-buddy) —
the Nordic UART Service + heartbeat-JSON wire protocol shape is the
same, so in principle a Paper running this firmware can also be driven
by that project's desktop bridge.

Bundled font: GenSenRounded Regular, from the M5Stack `M5EPD` library's
examples.
